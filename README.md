# Revamping the App 
Led an application revamp with 60+ new features, using Figma, Flutter, and JavaScript, resulting a 5-star app rating 

## Context 
The team needed UI/UX improvement because of user's feedback on its design and functionality. It was terrible. That is where I stepped in to revamp the app from user interface to user experience. 

## Method 
To start ideating designs, I initiated the research process by evaluating the current designs and functionalities of the app. This was done through usability testing on my own to get first-hand experience. However, my interactions with the app are just 1 out of ~800 users on the app. I went through the process of conducting usability interviews with current users to validate for a need to revamp and redesign. 

## Post Interviews and Insights :bulb: 
Feedback from users confirmed my initial assessments: the app's interface is unappealing, and its features disrupt the user experience, leading to poor usability. 

### User Feedback Highlights 

Visuals & Presentation: 

- 97% of users described the app's visual and presentation as "bland", "annoying to the eye", and not "modern or professional". 

Functionality: 

- 93% of users were confused about adding, editing, and removing a platform, a core feature of the app. 

User Flow: 

- 100% of users mistakenly clicked on "Edit Profile" to edit their bio, indicating a significant flaw in the user interface design.

## Ideated Designs 
The links below are Figma files showcasing all of the raw ideated designs. Check them out! You will need to sign in to your own Figma account but the files should be open and viewable.
