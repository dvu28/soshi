# Revamping the App

Led an application revamp with 60+ new features, using Figma, Flutter, and JavaScript, resulting a 5-star app rating

## Context
The team needed UI/UX improvement because of user's feedback on its design and functionaly. It was terrible. That is where I stepped in to revamp the app from user interface to user experience.
## Method
To start ideating designs, I initiated the research process by evaluating the current designs and functionalities of the app. This was done through usability testings on my own to get first-hand experience. However, my interactions with the app is just 1 out of ~800 users on the app. I went through the process of conducting usability interviews with current users to validate for a need to revamp and redesign.
## Post Interviews and Insights :bulb:
Feedback from users confirmed my initial assessments: the app's interface is unappealing and its features disrupt the user experience, leading to poor usability.

â€‹
**User Feedback Highlights:**


Visuals & Presentation:

- **97%** of users described the app's visual and presentation as "bland", "annoying to the eye", and not "modern or professional".

Functionality:

- **93%** of users were confused about adding, editing, and removing a platform, a core feature of the app.

User Flow:

- **100%** of users mistakenly clicked on "Edit Profile" to edit their bio, indicating a significant flaw in the user interface design.

## Validating Design Choices
